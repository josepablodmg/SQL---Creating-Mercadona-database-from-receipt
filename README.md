# SQL – Creating Mercadona Database from Receipt

For my **Databases class**, I created a **SQL database** based on an actual receipt from **Mercadona**, a major supermarket chain. The goal of this project was to practice **database design, table creation, and relational data modeling**.

## 🔹 Project Highlights
- Designed tables to represent products, prices, quantities, and categories.  
- Applied **primary and foreign keys** to maintain data integrity.  
- Practiced **SQL queries** to retrieve and analyze data efficiently.  
- Gained hands-on experience translating real-world transactional data into a structured database.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **SQL** (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite – adjust depending on what you used)  
- Database normalization and relational modeling
