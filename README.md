🔹 Project Highlights

Designed tables to represent products, prices, quantities, and categories.

Applied primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.

Practiced SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data efficiently.

Gained hands-on experience translating real-world transactional data into a structured database.

🛠️ Technologies

SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite – adjust depending on what you used)

Database normalization and relational modeling
